Hi 👋 My name is Ankita Singh
=============================

Machine Learning Researcher
---------------------------

I have been working on mining information from data, creating machine/deep learning models for tabular data, computer vision, NLP and time series analysis for past 6 years. I am currently a pro-active research assistant in the Department of Computer Science at Florida State University. Over the course of my research, I have become highly skilled in deep/machine learning, data mining, data modelling/analysis, Python, Keras, TensorFlow, scikit-learn and I love learning new things. To take the next step in my career, I am actively seeking full-time position in the field of machine learning. I am interested in using my skills and expertise to contribute towards building new products and experiences for consumers, as well as have a positive impact on the way we all work and live moving into the future.
