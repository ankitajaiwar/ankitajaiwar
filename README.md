Data Scientist
---------------------------

I have been working on mining information from data, creating machine/deep learning models for tabular data, computer vision, NLP and time series analysis for past 6 years. I am currently a Data Scientist at Cognomotiv. Over the course of my research and work years, I have become highly skilled in deep/machine learning, data mining, data modelling/analysis, Python, Keras, TensorFlow, scikit-learn and I love learning new things. I am interested in using my skills and expertise to contribute towards building new products and experiences for consumers, as well as have a positive impact on the way we all work and live moving into the future.
