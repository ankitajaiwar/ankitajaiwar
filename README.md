Hi üëã My name is Ankita Singh
=============================

Data Scientist
---------------------------

I have been working on mining information from data, creating machine/deep learning models for tabular data, computer vision, NLP and time series analysis for past 8 years. Over the course of my research and work years, I have become highly skilled in deep/machine learning, data mining, data modelling/analysis, Python, Keras, TensorFlow, scikit-learn and I love learning new things.

*   üåç¬† I'm based in New Jersey
*   ü§ù¬† I'm open to collaborating on Machine learning projects, deep learning projects
*   ‚ö°¬† I love dancing, painting and exploring outdoors. 

Highlighted Projects
-------------------------

<b>1. [Generic ML](https://github.com/ankitajaiwar/GenericML) </b>

   An end to end machine learning regression project utilizing various regression models to predict the student's performance based on features like parental education level, performance in other subjects,
   daily lunch type etc. The project is titled Generic ML as it is written in such a way that project structure and most of the code can be reused with any regression dataset. The EDA can be performed for the new dataset separately and data handling can be modified, most of the rest of the code can remain same.

<b>2. [Chicken Disease Classificatin - a CNN project](https://github.com/ankitajaiwar/Chicken-Disease-Classification)</b>

   This project aims to address the challenge of identifying diseases in chickens using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).This project leverages Python for scripting and development, TensorFlow/Keras for building and training machine learning models, Docker for containerization, Flask for serving the model as a web application, Git for version control, GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), and Data Version Control (DVC) for managing and versioning datasets.
   
<b>3. [End to End Text Summarization (NLP)](https://github.com/ankitajaiwar/Text-summarizer) </b>

   End-to-End Text Summarization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the process of automatically generating concise and coherent summaries from longer text documents or articles. The advanced abstractive text summarization model PEGASUS from the Hugging Face library has been utilized.
