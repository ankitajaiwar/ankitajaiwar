Hi 👋 My name is Ankita Singh
=============================

Data Scientist
---------------------------

I have been working on mining information from data, creating machine/deep learning models for tabular data, computer vision, NLP and time series analysis for past 6 years. I am currently a Data Scientist at Cognomotiv. Over the course of my research and work years, I have become highly skilled in deep/machine learning, data mining, data modelling/analysis, Python, Keras, TensorFlow, scikit-learn and I love learning new things. I am interested in using my skills and expertise to contribute towards building new products and experiences for consumers, as well as have a positive impact on the way we all work and live moving into the future.

Highlighted Projects
-------------------------

<b>1. [Generic ML]https://github.com/ankitajaiwar/GenericML </b>

   An end to end machine learning regression project utilizing various regression models to predict the student's performance based on features like parental education level, performance in other subjects,
   daily lunch type etc. The project is titled Generic ML as it is written in such a way that project structure and most of the code can be reused with any regression dataset. The EDA can be performed for the new dataset separately and data handling can be modified, most of the rest of the code can remain same.

<b>2. Chicken Disease Classificatin - a CNN project</b>
   
<b>4. End to End Text Summarization (NLP) </b>

<b>5. AWS Sagemaker example</b>

<b>6. End-to-End Cell Segmentation Using Yolo V8

<b>7. Audio Classification Project
